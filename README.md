# DowntownVisionsSafetyEscortApp
Our Goal: Create an app to connect citizens and visitors in Downtown Wilmington to Downtown Visions Safety Ambassadors for an escort within the Downtown District Neighborhood.

This repository contains source code for the app to connect citizens and visitors of Downtown Wilmington with a Safety Ambassador from Downtown Visions.  Downtown Visions is a private, non-profit organization that manages the Business Improvement District.  The Downtown Visions mission is to create, manage and promote a quality environment for people who live, work and visit Downtown Wilmington. This is accomplished by collaborating with the public and private sector entities in neighborhood revitalization and stabilization, through clean and safe initiatives, small business development, retail recruitment and retention, job creation and economic development.


# Who Are Safety Ambassadors?
Downtown Visions employs more than 30 uniformed Safety Ambassadors to assist the Wilmington Police Department in keeping Downtown Wilmington safe. Each Safety Ambassador receives over 80 hours of in-house training in addition to field training on topics such as crime prevention, customer service, local history and local attractions. Each Ambassador wears a distinctive black and yellow uniform and carries a two-way radio. You can find our Safety Ambassadors patrolling the Business Improvement District on foot and on bikes. Feel free to approach our Safety Ambassadors and request information about downtown. They can give you directions, information on restaurants, hotels and local shops â€” just ask!
