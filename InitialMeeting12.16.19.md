# Mike S:
Highest Priority:
Dispatch app
Messages on app get sent from customers to office via email.
Work orders/messages get sent to Ambassadors by central office.
Option for users to create account, but not made a requirement
Option for customers to include photo



Wish List:

Build payment system for vendors and trash customers to pay through app or website.
Trash company has about 70 customers
Unified events calendar to link local events
Vendor ability to add events to calendar
Would like to replace Verizon with online phone system
Integrate website into app



Number of Employees:
50 total
45 on street
5 in office

Tablets:
35 total

Cloud Storage:
1TB in-house server
AWS for excess (barely used)

Current Systems:
GeoPal
Used to see where Ambassadors are by management.
Do not use messaging feature due to extra cost.
Salesforce
Sounds like they barely use this at all
Main Street CRM
I think they keep their customer contact information here, but not sure.

Project Management Information:
We need to work with Zip Code staff to put together an Agreement of:
Services to be provided
Time-frame of deliverable
Wishlist for future features

Other Information:
Their site is currently business-focused, but they would like to make the map more public-focused.
They are willing to give us access to GeoPal.
They get about 75 different types of calls, but only about half a dozen of them make up the majority.
They have somewhat of a directory, but would like to be able to build a database to ask for donations.
Right now, the only work orders that are being documented are ones initiated by the Ambassadors because they don’t pay for the messenger/work order system from GeoPal.
A big percentage of the calls are for cleaning, reporting missing signs, picking up trash, and removing graffiti
IT Technologies at 9th and Tatnall handles their current IT work.
Wilmington has a service called “Report it or resolve it” that is apparently not very good.
311 is a service that is coming to the area to do similar work.



# Kievina

Highest Priority:
Interactive phase and escort services is the first step

Routed through central dispatch 
GPS feature
Hide location of ambassadors
Notification sent preferably via email to central dispatch
Ability for other reports to be made, e.g. environmental things

Hardware:

Software:
Databases: Salesforce, Microsoft Access, Downtown Diva, GeoPal has CRM function; these are not well integrated
Currently work with/hire Diamond Technologies
Access will be provided to GeoPal account

# Dave

Priority Focus:
Way to match safety ambassadors to clients who want an escort.  (concerned about safety of the ambassadors and their showing up as a moving location on a map.) 
Way to contact DTV via a picture and or message to let them know of issues in the neighborhood such as graffiti, or trash, missing signs, etc.  
Both should have an option to be anonymous or to give information if you prefer.
Wanted issues sent to a central office thru email (possible endpoint to list them all if logged in as an admin)
Way to know if the issue has been resolved if the person leaves an email of some sort.  

Wish List:

Pictures of staff and/or people wanting to use the ambassador client escort service.  (Would require access to users phone to allow them to take a picture from their location
Way to create jobs and send them to ambassadors.  Work order type system.  
Overall central location for people of Wilmington to go and see some of this information like farmers market, events, parking, etc.   
Way to accept payment and fees for things like commercial trash collection (approx. 70 customers), farmers market booths.  
More detailed information on the trash collection services for billing, payments, tonnage collected, etc. 
At the farmers market list of vendors and ability for food trucks to collect orders in advance.  
More cohesion of databases and technology being used like salesForce, Geopal. 

What we know:
Use GeoPal software but not using it to full capacity.  
Using SalesForce but also not being used to full capacity.  
Ambassadors use 35 tablets, 8”, recently purchased 10 new ones.  Samsung brand (even the new ones?) Not sure they want to continue down this route depending on other options.  They are open to new ideas.
Tablets use Verizon wireless with 2GB of data a month 
5 staff members in office, 45 operation, 50 total
Tablets run Android.  
Have a database that is relatively old that has 1 Terabyte of data with approximately 400GB used.
They use Diamond Tech @9th and Tatnall for tech stuff currently.

Questions for them:
What plan do they have with GeoPal/what features are available to them currently?
What SalesForce plan are they using?
More info on the database - what is it running - mySQL?, or maybe we could find that out with a make and model #.
Sounds like all Samsung and Android tablets.
What plan are they using with Verizon wireless?
Some sort of cloud data - what’s the storage and plan their using.  Sounds like AWS.
